        <p>Hi again, I am highly motivated BSc (Hons) graduate in <span>Computer Science</span> and  <span>Forensic Science</span>
            with a keen interest in <span>web development</span> and <span>software engineering</span>.<br></br> Recently, I have
            completed a web development bootcamp reinforcing my skills in <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, <span>SASS</span>
            and <span>GIT</span>. Additionally, I am experienced in employing a <span>scrum framework</span> for project
            managing, demonstrating my ability to effectively plan, coordinate, and deliver
            projects on time and within scope. <br></br> I am looking to further develop the skills I have
            gained during my academic studies and begin to <span>grow in a career towards web
            development</span>.</p>
